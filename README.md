hfc is a strongly opinionated tool for deploying AWS Lambda functions written
in Go with AWS CloudFormation.

It is hackishly implemented, relatively undocumented, and not necessarily easy
to use at the moment. I'm only making it public so a couple of personal
projects can take advantage of it.

Please come back, though, and things will probably be more advanced. Or, if I
abandon it but it looks nice to you, feel free to take advantage of the MIT
License.
